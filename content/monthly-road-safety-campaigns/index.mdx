# Monthly Road Safety Campaigns: A Personal Call by Matatu Owners' Association.

## Introduction

As a proud member of the Matatu Owners' Association (MOA), I am issuing a heartfelt appeal for the initiation of monthly National Road Safety Campaigns.

## Collaborative Approach

Under my leadership as the President of MOA, I underscore the importance of adopting a comprehensive and collaborative approach to these campaigns.

## Road Clinics Initiative

I am particularly passionate about the implementation of road clinics, designed to educate our esteemed drivers and subsequently mitigate the need for frequent matatu crackdowns and traffic-related court cases.

## Ongoing Efforts

During a recent Road Safety Campaign held at the Kisumu Bus Terminus, I had the privilege of discussing our ongoing efforts.

## Call to Action for Drivers

I implore all drivers to prioritize safety by abstaining from drunk driving, adhering to speed limits, and refraining from carrying excess passengers.

## Streamlining Operations

To streamline our operations, I urge traffic police to focus their efforts on registered Matatu Saccos rather than individual vehicle owners or drivers.

## Voluntary Inspections

As part of our commitment to safety, NTSA conducted voluntary inspections of approximately 200 PSV vehicles during the event.

## Support and Empowerment

In a gesture of support, MOA presented a 14-seater van valued at Sh 3.5m to the MOA-Kisumu, generously donated by GB Auto.

## Gratitude to Partners

In closing, I extend my gratitude to all partners, including NTSA, Traffic Police, and the Kenya Red Cross, for their unwavering support.
