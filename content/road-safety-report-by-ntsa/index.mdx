The NTSA's October Road Safety status report offers a month-by-month breakdown of the fatalities in 2023:

While the overall trend indicates a decrease in fatalities compared to the previous year, it's crucial to analyze the specific factors contributing to these accidents.

## Reflecting on 2022

In 2022, the country witnessed a significant increase in road accident casualties, with a total of 21,757 reported cases â€“ a 5.5% rise from the figures reported in 2021.

Among the casualties:

- Serious injuries: 9,935 victims
- Slight injuries: 7,132 victims
- Pedestrians: 1,682 fatalities
- Motorcyclists: 1,254 fatalities
- Drivers: 426 fatalities
- Passengers: 822 fatalities
- Pillion passengers: 445 fatalities
- Pedal cyclists: 61 fatalities

Passenger casualties saw a notable increase from 7,586 victims in 2021 to 9,161 in 2022, marking a significant percentage rise of 20.8%.

## Addressing the Causes

NTSA's analysis points to several leading causes of fatal crashes in 2022, including:

- Hit-and-runs
- Tyre bursts
- Vehicles and motorcycles losing control
- Overtaking improperly
- Failing to keep the proper lane resulting in head-on collisions

As efforts continue to enhance road safety measures, understanding these contributing factors becomes crucial for developing targeted interventions to reduce accidents and save lives on Kenyan roads.
