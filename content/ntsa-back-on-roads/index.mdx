# Expect NTSA back on roads - Statement by CS Murkomen

Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen announced the return of National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) officials on Kenyan roads. This decision follows consultations with Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki.

Murkomen stated that the directive will reverse an order issued by former President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018, which had eliminated NTSA officials from Kenyan roads.

"We will soon witness the return of NTSA, collaborating with traffic police to enforce traffic safety on our roads," Murkomen declared in a statement.

However, he did not specify the operational timeline for this decision. Murkomen highlighted that consultations with Interior CS Kithure Kindiki were instrumental in reaching this decision.

"We are establishing a mechanism to vacate the previous directive and reinstating NTSA's role in enforcement," Murkomen affirmed.

The Ministry of Transport, in collaboration with the Interior Ministry, will establish a collaborative regime between NTSA and the National Police Service for more efficient enforcement.

NTSA officers will now work in collaboration with traffic police to enhance road safety.

This decision comes in response to a tragic road accident along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway involving a Kenyatta University bus and a trailer. The accident claimed the lives of 11 students and left 42 others injured, some critically.

Kenya has witnessed several devastating road accidents in recent times, including a fatal incident along Olonguruone-Silibwet Road in Bomet, where five individuals lost their lives and 18 others were injured in a collision between a matatu and a tractor.

According to NTSA statistics, road accidents claimed 649 lives from January to February 2024, marking an increase compared to the same period in 2023 when 623 fatalities were recorded.

In response to the alarming rise in road accidents, Interior CS Kindiki announced a nationwide crackdown targeting all unroadworthy vehicles, drivers, riders, and pedestrians. The crackdown aims to enforce traffic laws and curb the tide of deaths and injuries from road accidents.

"We must obey traffic rules and work together to clean our roads from all manner of rogue road users," Kindiki emphasized during his announcement in Kisumu.
